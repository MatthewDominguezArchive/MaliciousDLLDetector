# MaliciousDLLDetector
Detect malicious DLL's that have been loaded into your program!

I previously posted a simple [DLL Injector](https://github.com/MatthewDominguezArchive/DLLInjector) to my GitHub. Even though I mentioned that it cannot be used to bypass modern Anti-Viruses / Anti-Cheat systems, I still decided to create a method to detect potentially malicious dll's that have been loaded into an applications memory. It does this by compaing file paths, and hashes. If you find use for this my work is well worth it, if you don't it was still fun to make.
